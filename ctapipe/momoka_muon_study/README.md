# Muon Study files
Study files from 2019 Fall Semester Research at University of Zurich by Momoka Goto

### Usage
This study focuses on testing the fitting algorithms for the muon files. Three notebook files are uploaded.
- three fits for MC file (FlashCam)
- three fits for fake muon generation files (FlashCam)
- optical efficiency difference (LSTCam)
For different camera types, modification in code is required

### Files in the study
 The notebook read files for the algorithm test. Tested Monte Carlo simulation files were given by my Supervisor, Allison Mitchell.
